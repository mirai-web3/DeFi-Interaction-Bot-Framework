Please help me extend the framework to create a [Protocol] interaction bot following our established patterns.
```

### **Research Request**
```
I'm interested in building a bot for [Protocol Name] but need help understanding their architecture. Can you:

1. Research their main interaction patterns
2. Identify key contract addresses for [network]
3. Analyze their API structure (if they have one)
4. Suggest which framework components need customization
5. Recommend the optimal interaction sequence

Protocol website: [URL]

I need to integrate with [Contract Name] at [address] on [network]. The contract has these key functions:

[paste ABI or function signatures]

Please help me:
1. Add this contract to the BaseTransactionHandler
2. Create wrapper methods for the main functions
3. Implement proper error handling and gas estimation
4. Add balance checking and approval logic where needed
5. Include transaction logging with our standard format
```

## **üêõ Debugging & Optimization**

### **Error Investigation**
```
I'm getting this error when running my [Protocol] bot:

Error: [paste full error message]

Context:
‚Ä¢ Network: [network name]
‚Ä¢ Wallet: [0x1234...5678]
‚Ä¢ Step: [which interaction was running]
‚Ä¢ Transaction: [tx hash if available]

Please help me:
1. Identify the root cause
2. Suggest fixes following our framework patterns
3. Add better error handling for this scenario
4. Update the retry logic if needed
```

### **Performance Review**
```
My [Protocol] bot is running but I want to optimize it. Current stats:

‚Ä¢ Success rate: [X%]
‚Ä¢ Average time per wallet: [X minutes]
‚Ä¢ Common failures: [list main issues]
‚Ä¢ Proxy usage: [X/Y proxies working]

Please review my implementation and suggest:
1. Performance improvements
2. Better error handling strategies
3. Proxy management optimizations
4. Interaction timing adjustments
```

## **üìä Results & Analytics**

### **Custom Results Display**
```
I want to customize the results display for my [Protocol] bot. It currently tracks:

‚Ä¢ [Current interaction 1]: Success/failure
‚Ä¢ [Current interaction 2]: Count-based (X/Y)
‚Ä¢ [Current interaction 3]: Amount-based

I want to add:
‚Ä¢ [New metric 1]: [description]
‚Ä¢ [New metric 2]: [description]

Please help me:
1. Update the InteractionTracker class
2. Add appropriate emojis for new metrics
3. Modify the display format to include new data
4. Maintain consistency with framework standards
```

### **Analytics Enhancement**
```
I want to add better analytics to track:

‚Ä¢ Success rates over time
‚Ä¢ Most profitable wallets
‚Ä¢ Best performing proxies
‚Ä¢ Interaction timing optimization
‚Ä¢ Gas usage patterns

Please help me extend the framework to capture and display this data while maintaining our clean terminal interface.
```

## **üîÑ Framework Updates**

### **Component Improvement**
```
I noticed [issue/limitation] with the [Component Name] class. For example:

[describe specific issue or limitation]

This affects [which bots/scenarios].

Please help me:
1. Improve the base component
2. Maintain backward compatibility
3. Update documentation
4. Test with existing implementations
```

### **Standards Update**
```
I want to propose updating our framework standards for [specific area]:

Current approach: [describe current method]
Proposed change: [describe new approach]
Benefits: [list advantages]
